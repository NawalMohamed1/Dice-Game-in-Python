# Dice-Game-in-Python


**Objective**: The objective of this project is to create a two-player dice game in which the players take turns rolling a six-sided dice, and the player with the higher roll wins the round. The game consists of three rounds, and the player who wins the most rounds is declared the overall winner.

**Key Features**:

1. **Player Input**: The game begins by prompting the two players to enter their names.

2. **Round Simulation**: The game simulates three rounds. In each round, both players roll a six-sided die, and the results are displayed.

3. **Winner Determination**: After each round, the program determines the winner of that round based on the higher dice roll. The winner's name is displayed.

4. **Overall Winner**: At the end of three rounds, the program calculates and announces the overall winner based on the number of rounds won by each player.

5. **Randomness**: The `random` module is used to simulate the randomness of dice rolls.

6. **User Interaction**: The program provides user-friendly prompts and messages to engage the players.
